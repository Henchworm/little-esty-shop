### Collaborators:

## Background and Description

Bulk Discounts is an extension of Little Etsy Shop, a project that emphasizes CRUD and complex database queries. 
Bulk Discounts builds upon the functionality of Little Etsy Shop, incorporating a "Bulk Discount" model that can be applied to invoices. 
Bulk Discounts highlights crud functionality, scaliling up an existing Rails Application, and integrating API calls using the facade design pattern. 


## Learning Goals
- Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
- Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
- Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
- Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
- Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
- Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application

## Requirements
- must use Rails 5.2.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- all code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and github projects to track progress on user stories
- must include a thorough README to describe the project
- must deploy completed code to Heroku
